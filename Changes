          - fix test failure caused by unstated assumption that
            Dist::Zilla::Role::TestRunner is a very recent version

          - fix breakage caused by unstated assumption that
            Dist::Zilla::Role::TestRunner is a very recent version

          - now dumping config data for [MetaConfig], including the configs
            used by [ModuleBuild] and [ModuleBuildTiny] (composed by this
            plugin)
          - ensure 'use strict; use warnings;' remains near the top of
            Build.PL, as some plugins use it as a matching point for adding
            new content

0.005     2014-06-08 06:12:39Z
          - lowered default minimum Module::Build version from 0.3601 to 0.28,
            to handle more legacy systems; documented the configuration
            options better

0.004     2014-06-06 05:37:01Z
          - add 'mb_version', 'mbt_version' options, for specifying the
            minimum required version of Module::Build and Module::Build::Tiny

0.003     2014-05-29 21:47:58Z
          - skip [ModuleBuild]'s configure_requires declaration, because if
            Module::Build is running, the prereqs were being ignored anyway

0.002     2014-05-23 07:47:57Z
          - minor doc fixes
          - handle some potential future changes to [ModuleBuild],
            [ModuleBuildTiny]

0.001     2014-05-22 07:31:17Z
          - Initial release.
